This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common when dealing with asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, where the state update might not be instantaneous.

```javascript
//Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('some-api')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>  //Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    </View>
  );
}
```
